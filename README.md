# Pi-Radio-mp3-
Raspberry pi internet radio and mp3 player
===Deprecated===

This internet radio and mp3 player uses a 3.5 HDMI LCD touch screen for operation. The original project was published by Adafruit. https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-radio-player-with-touchscreen/overview The project uses MPC , MPD and Pygame.

Installation:

Download the raspbian stretch image and burn to a 8GB or bigger SD card. To start you should be know how to SSH to the      raspberry pi. You can also connect a mouse and keyboard to the pi and install everything locally. See https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/

Attach the LCDscreen to the raspberry pi. 

After the Pi boots up, connect to the internet. Open the terminal screen and type

    sudo raspi-config

Set internationalisation options and change Timezone 

Go to Advanced Options and enable VNC and set the resolution to 640x480

Exit and reboot.

The stretch image takes a lot of space on the SD card and we need to make room for the MP3 music. SSH to the Pi and delete Wolfram and Libreoffice, or use the mouse on the Pi and select add/remove.

    sudo apt-get purge wolfram-engine libreoffice* -y

    sudo apt-get clean

    sudo apt-get autoremove

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get upgrade

After the upgrade you are ready for the installation. Now install the LCD drivers.

    git clone https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show.git

    sudo chmod -R 755 LCD-show

    cd LCD-show

    sudo ./MPI3508-show

The resolution used with the pi-radio is 640x480, therefore you need change the config.txt.

    sudo nano /boot/config.txt

and change the resolution at the bottom of the file to 640x480. Save, exit and reboot.

    sudo reboot

At this point the Pi should boot to the stretch desktop and the touchscreen working. Now install the Pi-radio files.
    
    sudo apt-get install mpc mpd
    
    cd

    git clone https://github.com/granpino/Pi-Radio-mp3-.git

    sudo chmod -R 755 Pi-Radio-mp3-

    cd Pi-Radio-mp3-

    sudo ./install.sh

The installation file will create the required playlists for mp3 and internet radio. There should be an icon on the raspberry desktop. To open the Pi-radio double tap on the radio shortcut. To change the desktop for a single click go to file manager, click on Edit and at the very bottom select preferences. Select 'open files with single click'.

The application uses pygame and the touchscreen will only run under lx-terminal. I you run the application from SSH, the touchscreen will work upside down. I elected to run the app from the desktop because I want to run other apps on the same Pi that use the LCD screen. I did not have to calibrate the screen to make it work. I included some sample mp3 files and radio stations for your testing. To add other radio stations to the playlist go to http://www.radiosure.com/stations/ and copy the m3u links. 

    mpc add <link of station>

    mpc save playlist

or edit the file 

    sudo nano ~/var/lib/mpd/playlists/playlist

To add other mp3 files, transfer these to the Music folder and type 

    sudo ls -1 /home/pi/Music/*.mp3 > /var/lib/mpd/playlists/mp3.m3u

THE mpd.conf FILE;

The mpd.conf file needs to show the location of the mp3 files. If you put your mp3 files in the Music folder then open the mpd.conf file.

    sudo nano /etc/mpd.conf

and change the file location to

    music_directory                        "/home/pi/Music"

If you wish to put your mp3 files in a USB stick then change to

    music_directory                       "/mnt/usbdrive"

BLUETOOTH

It would be nice to sent the music to a bluetooth speaker. If you are using a Raspberry pi 2, insert a bluetooth dongle int the USB slot. Go to the raspberry desktop and click on the bluetooth icon then add device. Select your bluetooth speaker and pair. Some speakers will require a password, sometimes 0000. You will need a mouse to righ-click on the speaker icon on the menu to connect.

You will also need to edit the mpd.conf file to include the bluetooth speaker.

    bluetoothctl
Copy the speaker mac address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.

    exit
    sudo nano /etc/mpd.conf

Look for the audio output and paste the mac address

    audio_output {
           type            "alsa"
        name            "bluetooth-speaker "
        device          "bluealsa:HCI=hci0,DEV=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx,PROFILE=a2dp"
        mixer_type      "software"
    }
You can have more than one bluetooth device

    audio_output {
        type            "alsa"
        name            "headphone "
        device          "bluealsa:HCI=hci0,DEV=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx,PROFILE=a2dp"
        mixer_type      "software"
    }
If you want to listen to the audio jack and bluetooth at the same time, then add a second audio output as;

    audio_output {
        type            "alsa"
        name            "hdmi audio jack"
    }
